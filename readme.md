# JavaScript Jotting

## Chapter One: 

JavaScript(JS): This works to enable interactivity in web pages. HTML provides the content and structure, CSS provides the styling and layout, and JavaScript provides the interactivity. 

JavaScript is fundamentally one of the three languages that are native to the web. The other two languages are HTML semantic markup language & CSS styling and layout language. All three are very different from one another in purpose and function, but they are all meant to work together in one single environment. 

### Exercise 1.02: Can I Use This Feature?

There is no easy way to tell which versions of JavaScript are supported by which browsers. A more reliable approach is to test whether the features you wish to use are supported by the engine currently running the code. Lets take a look at the Can I use table:
1. Open a web browser and instruct it to load <https://caniuse.com/> Notice that you have immediate access to the latest and most searched features directly from the home page, without even searching:
2. Locate the search area toward the top, which reads Can I use ___________?,and type in finally, since we want to see which browsers support Promise.prototype.finally. The results for our search will be displayed automatically within a colored grid

> Note that certain blocks are red, while others are green. A red color indicates that 
the feature is unsupported, and green indicates that the feature is supported. You 
may also see a yellow color, indicating partial support.
3. If you want to see the specifics pertaining to a certain browser version, hover your 
cursor over the indicated version or version range and a small overlay will appear 
with additional information such as the date of version release and even usage 
statistics for that version.

### Accessing Web Browser Developer Tools (Windows)

When writing JavaScript for the web browser, it is important to know how to access and use the browser developer toolsâ€”especially the JavaScript console tab.

To access developer tools and the JavaScript console within Chrome, you can right-click anywhere in the viewport and choose ***Inspect*** from the menu that appears. Once the developer tools are open, click on the ***Console*** tab to inspect and write JavaScript code within Chrome itself.

Using the Chrome developer tools, you can filter the sort of things that show errors, warnings, or even just information such as that returned by **console.log()**. You can even write JavaScript within the browser using the **Console** tab view, as you'll see shortly. There is also a **Sources** tab, which allows for modifying and debugging of code.

### Accessing Web Browser Developer Tools (Apple Safari)

On Apple macOS and iOS operating systems, Safari is the default web browser and is tightly integrated into the user experience on those machines. Similar to Windows and Internet Explorer/Edge, many users will never deviate from the browser that is preinstalled on their machine.Safari was once even available on Windows, but development ceased with the final Windows version in 2012.

To access the developer tools and the JavaScript console within Safari, you must first 
tweak some of the preferences within the browser itself.
1. First, access the preferences dialog by choosing **Safari | Preferences** through the **Application** menu.
2. Within the **Preferences** dialog, click on the tab called **Advanced**.
3. Once the contents of the **Advanced** tab has appeared, look to the bottom and enable the **Show Develop menu in menu bar option**
4. With that option enabled, close the **Preferences** dialog.
5. Now, choose the newly enabled **Develop** option from the **Application** menu and select **Show JavaScript Console** to display the developer tools. You can also right-click and choose **Inspect Element** as well.
